		<p>
			I am a visiting student at <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> this summer. I just get a job as a software developer at Athenahealth, Inc. in its San Francisco office and will start working from this October. Before that I worked as a mobile developer at a startup company located at the heart of sillicon valley for about half a year shortly after graduation.

			I have a B.S. in Physics from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. At NC State I firstly focused on studying semicondutor technology but later on when it came close to graduation I found my interest in software and decided to set the path of my career in this realm. What a great and lucky decision!
